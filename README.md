# Quiz
An Angular 2 web application that converts between different currencies. Used to demonstrate template features.

To work on this project:

* Run `npm install` inside the project folder to download all the dependencies. This only needs to be done once.
* Run `npm run build` to compile the TypeScript code in the `app` folder into ES5 code into the `build` folder.
* Run `npm run serve` to start a local development web server. You can now access the application at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).
